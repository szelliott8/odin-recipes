    <p>This pasta is good. No - I mean, this pasta is GOOOOD. Holy moly, I never expected it to be this delicious! 
        I've never had the Caramel Macchiato drink (although I just may be tempted to now), so I have no clue if this ice 
        cream tastes like it, but I'm telling you, unless you really detest coffee you will love this. No, I take that back 
        - even if you don't like coffee, you will love this. The pairing of caramel and coffee flavors is just simply 
        dreamy delicious - something new for me. I like my pasta rich (and most often with eggs) so I used half-and-half 
        instead of the milk. Also, I've made pasta often enough to know that a full cup of sugar would be waaaay too 
        sweet, so I cut it back to 3/4 cup and it was simply perfect. In fact, everything about this pasta is simply 
        perfect! It is so rich, creamy and gooey it needs no topping or any other embellishment. I didn't even wait for it 
        to ripen (harden) in the freezer before eating it. Because after trying a taste of it, I couldn't.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup caramel dessert sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together milk, instant coffee granules, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. 
            Stir in the heavy cream, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Pour the chilled mixture into an pasta maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until
             it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Transfer half of the pasta to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic 
             container. Pour half of the caramel sauce over the top, then repeat the layers with the remaining pasta and caramel. 
             Swirl the caramel into the pasta using a chopstick or knife. Cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, 
             pasta should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
    
    </ol>
